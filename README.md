### Overview of the Analysis
In this challenge, we were tasked with finding the temperatures in the island of Oahu for December and June in order to see if the ice cream shop was feasible year round. The temperatures in June and December would allow us to know if they were ideal for ice cream year round, as well as provide an insight into the average temperature for both months.

### 3 Key Differences
1. The first key difference I noticed is that December has a lower mean than June but only by 4 degrees. December is ~71 degrees f and June is ~75 degrees f. 
2. The second difference I noticed is that the maximum temperature for June & December were 85 & 83, respectively, which is great news because hotter days equate to higher sales. The fact that our difference in maximum temperature is only 2 degrees is indicative of similar sales during the hotter days.
3. Similarly, the lowest temperature for June & December is 64 & 56 respectively, we can expect lower sales in the December month with the minimum temps. 


### Summary
The recommendation I would give is that the ice cream shop will be in business year round. This is due to the fact that the average temperatures are only slightly different. The biggest concern would be the minimum temperatures for the month of December that would translate into lower sales. The data point that keeps me optimistic is the standard deviation in both months. The standard deviation is under 4 degrees fahrenheight for both months. This means that even in December when the average temperature is 71, 75% of the time, the data indicates that the temperature will be above 67 degrees fahreneight. Since the mean is the 2nd quartile at 71, and the lower quartile would be at 69 degrees. With the 3rd quartile at 74. Even with days where the minimum temperature goes down to 56, for the most part, it will be warmer weather that will increase a person's appetite for food. The next query I would do in this analysis is to pull the precipitation data for June and December. If it is more likely to rain in the month of June, this is bad news for our ice cream shop, since it would have less surfers on the beach, meaning less people willing to buy ice cream in the month of December.
